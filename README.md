## Background of the project
This is an improved version of my previously made console game.

I wrote the previous game when I started experimenting with python. It was about a year ago from the creation of this project! I'd like to see how much I improved since then. I uploaded the old version of the game for reference by the name of "app_old.py".

## Technical data:
Used languages/file types:
* python 3.9.8
   * This is the base language used to program the game. There is also a script included that sorts the wordlist and gives a few statistics back from it.
* txt
   * The wordlist is a txt file which you can edit really easily. I am also planning a feature to the game, where you can add and remove words from the console and change the base list.
* ini
   * There is a settings.ini file included which will hold the most basic settings to the game. I'm planning on using the [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html "Configparser documentation") module to edit and read the settings file.
